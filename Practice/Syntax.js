// This is the syntax for a print statement in JS
// Printing a string with JS
console.log('Hello World!');

//Assign a variable
var y=2;
console.log(y); 

// 'let' variables
// This is a scenario where it might be used: "I might want to use this variable again later to hold different data, but in this code block I'll only use it once."

// 'const' variables
// More specific than 'let'
// A variable that is only used once
