# UFOs
Create a dynamic table with data stored in a JS array.

## Overview
* In this project I used JavaScript functions and HTML to create an interactive webpage using UFO sighting data. There are multiple filters to search and return databases based on the input. 

## Results
* Here is how the filters are displayed in the HTML webpage:

* They allow the user to look up UFO sightings based on Date, City, State, Country and the UFO shape itself. 

* Here it is in action returning results after some filters are populated:

* This returned all the sphere shaped sightings in the state of Florida (fl)

## Summary 
**Cons:**
* There are some cons to this HTML webpage. For instance it is case sensitive to the inputs. In the above example I could not directly type out "Florida" in the "state" filter box or other variations of the state name. This is not the case for other websites that still returns relevant results when a user mistypes a key word or adds an underscore or space after the word. In order for this filtered data to return to correct info, the user has to input the keyword without spaces after and spelled correctly.

**Additional Recommendations:**
* I would make the recommendation to fix the case sensitivity of keywords when they are typed in the filter box. In the event that a user mises a letter or adds an extra space, some relevant results should still return after the query. 

* Another recommendation would have to regard the date format. What if a user wants to find all the events for a specific month? A user can only search for specific dates of the year instead of entire months at a time.
